# LibFlyable

**Replacement for the IsFlyableArea API function in World of Warcraft.**

Avoids these long-standing bugs with IsFlyableArea:

- Broken Isles zones are only flyable with the Broken Isles Pathfinder ability.
- Draenor zones are only flyable with the Draenor Pathfinder ability.
- Certain maps like Argus and the Tanaan Jungle Intro are not flyable.
- Certain Legion class halls are not flyable.


## Usage

```lua
lib = LibStub("LibFlyable")
isFlyable = lib:IsFlyableArea() -- true/false
```

I will not notice relevant game changes unless someone tells me about them.
